# Pool creation FAQ

## Errors

<details>

<summary>I can't see my pool</summary>

It can take a few minutes for your pool to display on the UI after creation. If you created your pool on a timer, you can check its status on the swap interface: inputting the base and quote tokens will display a countdown in place of the swap button. - don't hesitate to share that countdown with your community.

Tip: You can quickly show created pools by ticking "show created" at the top of the list.

<summary>Pool already created error</summary>

A pool already exists for this token pair. No need to create a new pool, you can [provide liquidity](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/liquidity-providers/liquidity-pools) to the existing one.

<details>

<summary>Token verify error / Freeze authority enables</summary>

This error means that your token has [freeze authority](https://spl.solana.com/token#freezing-accounts) enabled. You can either disable it programmatically or use a no-code spl manager like [Squads](https://app.squads.so/).
