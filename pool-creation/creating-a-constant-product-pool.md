# Creating a Constant Product Pool

{% hint style="info" %}
Raydium has deployed a new standard AMM program ([CP-Swap](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-cp-swap)), which adds support for Token-2022 assets and **no longer requires an OpenBook market ID.**

Program Address: `CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C`

Users can also choose to create a Legacy AMMv4 pool on the UI. These pools are more expensive becuase they require rent (SOL) to create the underlying Openbook Market.

Permissionless pools allow anyone to create a liquidity pool on Raydium.
