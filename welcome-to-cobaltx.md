# Welcome to CobaltX

## Swapping

**Charts**: V3 now onboards charts for any tradable token pairs on Raydium. This feature is accessible from both mobile and desktop platforms and can be easily toggled off by clicking the icon located at the top right corner of the swap UI.

Please note: The data available on the chart view represents historical prices from Birdeye and does not necessarily originate exclusively from Raydium pool data.
{% endhint %}

**Finding tokens:** The new swap GUI now integrates Jupiter tokens lists (strict or all) on top of the Raydium list. You can adjust your token list settings by clicking on a ticker and selecting "view token list". To prevent users from swapping for an incorrect token, Raydium prompts users to paste the contract address of tokens not included in any of the token lists. You can find this address directly on the project documentation, Raydium pool list, or any explorer.

**Exact out**: Raydium V3 introduces a new bi-directional routing engine. Raydium's Swap UI now allows you to input the exact amount of quote token you wish to receive from a swap. When using Exact Out the slippage is applied to the base token amount. For example, you can specify the exact amount you'd like to swap for, with only the amount of base token paid susceptible to deviation from the quote based on your slippage tolerance.

## Portfolio

Raydium V3 introduces a new portfolio page, displaying user positions. This page serves as the main interface for users to manage their positions (such as adding/withdrawing liquidity, collecting yield, etc.). However, users can create pools and positions from the pool list.&#x20;

This new page also offers quick access for pool and farm creators to edit their incentive campaigns.

## Liquidity <a href="#liquidity" id="liquidity"></a>

The Liquidity Pools page now consolidates all Raydium liquidity under one roof. You can easily access CLMM, Standard (AMM pools), or ALL pools on the same interface. Additionally, this new page also comes with a **card view** which can be toggled by clicking the settings button next to the search bar.

## User settings <a href="#user-settings" id="user-settings"></a>

All user settings and customization, which were previously scattered across different windows, are now reunited in the top right corner of your screen.

You'll notice two additions to the user's customizations:

**Language package**: Experience Raydium in your language! You can now choose your preferred language from the settings panel. The list of supported languages is expected to expand with community support.
