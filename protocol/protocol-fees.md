# Protocol Fees

For every swap that happens in a pool on Raydium, a small trading fee is taken. Depending on the specific fee of a given pool, this fee is split and goes to incentivizing liquidity providers, RAY buybacks, and the treasury.

**Concentrated liquidity (CLMM) pools**: The trading fee for each CLMM pool is set to one of eight fee tiers; 2%, 1%, 0.25%, 0.05%, 0.04%, 0.03%, 0.02%, and 0.01%. Liquidity providers earn 84% of the trading fee for every swap in the pool, while 12% of fees are allocated to RAY buybacks and the final 4% to the treasury.

The remaining 4% treasury fees from CLMM pool trades are auto-swapped to USDC and transferred to [CHynyGLd4fDo35VP4yftAZ9724Gt49uXYXuqmdWtt68F](https://solscan.io/account/CHynyGLd4fDo35VP4yftAZ9724Gt49uXYXuqmdWtt68F) (previously sent to [6pJu](https://solscan.io/account/6pJuA19E33AFdPh9oWkWY3u6yCdiqAm26AdcFJQBUhLU)).
