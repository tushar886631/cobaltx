# SPL Wallet

Before you get started using Raydium, you'll need a Solana Program Library (SPL) wallet for storing your funds on the Solana blockchain and for interacting with the Raydium Program.

Donâ€™t forget to fund your wallet with SOL, as it is required to execute a transaction on the Solana network. It is recommended to keep a minimum of 0.05 SOL in your wallet to avoid failed transactions. If you need to top up your wallet, please read the following [guide](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/getting-started/spl-wallets/buying-and-selling-digital-assets).

Raydium supports many wallets including those recommended below.ðŸ‘‡

[Phantom](https://phantom.com/) offers a wallet and browser extension with a streamlined, user-friendly interface. Raydium highly suggests Phantom for new users and those that want a simple and straightforward wallet experience.

[Solflare](https://solflare.com/) is another digital wallet that enables universal access to the Solana blockchain and its associated applications. Solflare offers both a browser extension wallet and a web-page based wallet, the latter being particularly handy to monitor transactions history.

[Backpack](https://www.backpack.app/) is an intuitive next-generation browser extension allowing users to import SPL and ERC-20 addresses in the same wallet. Minting executable NFTs known as xNFT on Backpack allows users to access dApps natively in a single interface.

**Mobile Wallets:**

If you are accessing Raydium through your mobile device you can get started by using the Phantom or Solflare wallets available on both [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/phantom-solana-wallet/id1598432977) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.phantom).

Note that you can import your 12 or 24 word seed phrase used on your wallet extension to import your wallet to a mobile device.
