# Buying and selling digital assets

As mentioned in the [SPL Wallet guide](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/getting-started/spl-wallets), performing any action on the network like interacting with on-chain smart contracts like Raydium ones requires your SPL wallet to be topped up with SOL.&#x20;

The on-ramping and off-ramping can be performed on CEX, directly on the wallet offering the option, or directly on Raydium.io.

&#x20;This service is provided by [Moonpay](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/getting-started/spl-wallets/www.moonpay.com), please refer to their documentation and support for additional information.
