# Best practices

_**Always verify the URL of the website**_ you are interacting with before connecting your wallet. Raydium.io is Raydium's only domain name. Any variation you may see on social networks, on a video description, or on an NFT is illegitimate and should be treated as dangerous.

_**Always verify the transaction you are signing.**_ Whether you are on a legitimate website or not, always give a double-take before approving a transaction on your wallet.

_**Do your own research**_. Raydium like many other dAPP is a fully permissionless platform. Raydium smart contracts allow any project or community to create a pool or farm.

* **Verify the token address**: Ticker and Logo are set freely by token creators, the token mint is the true identity of a token. It suggested for users to copy and paste contract addresses rather than typing in the ticker.
* **Read the documentation** before interacting with smart contracts. If you have doubts about the implications of one of your actions, feel free to join the Raydium [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6EvFwvCfpx) or [Telegram](https://t.me/raydiumprotocol) for 24/7 support.
* **Pay attention to warnings.** Whether it is a slippage warning informing you of potential bad execution or a confirmation to add a new mint to your token list, always read the information before approving.
* Make sure you have read and understand [Raydium disclaimer](https://raydium.io/docs/disclaimer/).
