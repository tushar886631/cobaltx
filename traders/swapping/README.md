# Swapping

**How to Swap**

1. Navigate to Swap using the navigation menu at the top of the app, then connect [your wallet](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/trading-on-serum/spl-wallets).
2. Next, select from the drop-down the tokens you want to swap or paste the token mint address. For this example, we'll be swapping **From** SOL **To** RAY.
3. Enter the amount of tokens you want to swap or receive. Finally, click Swap!
4. Shortly after the transaction is confirmed you should be able to see your new balance, although this can sometimes take a few seconds to refresh.

You have now done your first swap on Raydium. Now let's get swapping!

{% hint style="warning" %}
Pay close attention to Price Impact and remember to check 'Minimum Received' when executing large swaps or when swapping in a low liquidity pool.
{% endhint %}

**Minimum Received** is the least amount of tokens a user will receive on a trade.

**Price Impact** is the difference between the market price and the estimated execution price based on the size of the trade.

**Slippage Tolerance** is the maximum difference between a user's estimated price and execution price. You can access this parameter both by clicking on the slippage icon on the top right corner of the swap interface and from the settings panel.

If you see the **TimeOut** error, it means that the transaction hasn't reached the chain.

To improve your chances of landing a transaction, you can increase your priority fees on the top right corner of your screen. However, be careful not to overspend on priority fees, they are non-deterministic and do not guarantee bloc inclusion.
